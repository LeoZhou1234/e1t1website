    My name is Leo Zhou. I am an incoming freshman to Lowell High School in San Francisco, CA. My hobbies include playing video games, photography, and digital art. A fun fact about me is that I play chess. Not well, but I do know how the pieces move. I joined E1T1 to get an experience in the practical and occupational applications of computer science.
